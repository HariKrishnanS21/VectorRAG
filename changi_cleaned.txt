FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CHANGI AIRPORT EARLY CHECK-IN What options are available for early check-in at Changi Airport, and how do they differ from regular check-in? At Changi Airport, passengers have the option to check in early for added convenience. Early check-in allows travellers to drop off their baggage and receive their boarding passes ahead of their scheduled departure, starting from 3 to 24 hours before the flight. This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport’s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues. Can passengers complete the early check-in process online for all airlines operating out of Changi Airport, or are there exceptions? Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability. Are there any specific requirements or documents needed to complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport? To complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers. Some airlines may also require travellers to enter visa details or other travel documentation depending on their destination. It’s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process. How can passengers with special needs or requests, such as extra baggage or special assistance, manage these needs when checking in online? When checking in online, passengers with special needs or additional requests can manage these preferences through the airline’s website. Most airline interfaces offer options to add extra baggage, request assistance at the airport, or make other necessary arrangements. If specific needs aren’t addressed on the online check-in platform, passengers should contact the airline directly to ensure all accommodations are in place before arriving at the airport. What steps should passengers follow if they encounter issues during the online check-in process? If passengers encounter any difficulties during the online check-in process, it's important to address the issue promptly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey. Here are the steps you should follow: Check Your Internet Connection: Sometimes, issues can be as simple as a faulty internet connection. Ensure your device is connected to a stable internet service to avoid interruptions during the check-in process. Verify Your Details: Double-check the accuracy of all required information, such as your booking reference, ticket number, and passport details. Errors in these entries can prevent successful check-in. Consult the Airline's FAQ or Help Section: Most airline websites have a FAQ or help section where common issues with online check-in are addressed. This can be a quick way to solve your problem without needing to contact customer service. Contact the Airline Directly: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, contact the airline's customer service for assistance. Have your booking details ready to facilitate a quick resolution. Airlines typically offer support via phone, email, or live chat. Visit the Jewel Early Check-In Lounge: If you encounter technical difficulties during the online check-in process and cannot resolve them through digital means, head over to the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge at Changi Airport to check in. By following these steps, passengers can effectively address issues encountered during online check-in, minimising delays and ensuring that their travel plans remain on track. For passengers using early check-in, where can they drop off their luggage at Changi Airport, and during what hours is this service available? For passengers who opt for early check-in at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, luggage can be conveniently dropped off at the counters located within the lounge itself. For passengers with odd-sized baggage, passengers flying on airlines departing from Terminal 1 may check in their odd-sized baggage at Jewel Early Check-in Lounge (except Scoot and Qatar Airways).

Automated Immigration Clearance GST Refund Reporting Cash Automated Immigration Clearance For express immigration self-clearance, travellers can use the automated gates. All travellers can enjoy the convenience of automated clearance when they depart Singapore via Changi Airport if their biometrics have been enrolled during arrival immigration clearance. Travellers can use automated clearance as long as they hold a valid International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) compliant passport. For more information, please refer to ICA’s website GST Refund GST Refund When you buy goods in Singapore, you are required to pay GST on your purchases if the retailer is registered for GST. The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows you to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport, subject to the criteria and conditions of the scheme. How does the Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS) work? The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows eligible tourists to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport. To be eligible for a GST refund under this scheme, you must satisfy all the following criteria: You are 16 years of age or above on the date of the purchase; You are not a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore; You are not a member of the crew of an aircraft on which you are departing Singapore; and You are not a Specified Person* - on the date of the purchase; at any time within the period of 3 months immediately before the date of purchase; or on the date you submit your claim for a refund of the GST charged on your purchases at the airport; *For the definition of Specified Person, please refer to the GST Refund Guide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme (link below) The eTRS is a paperless process; you will not receive any eTRS ticket, and purchases will be tagged to your passport. If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal at https://touristrefund.sg . Applying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration. Don’t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop. Which retailers participate in eTRS? As eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency. There are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore: Global Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd. Global Blue retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Blue' sign in their shops. Website: http://www.globalblue.com/ Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd. Global Tax Free retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Tax Free' sign in their shops. Website: http://www.global-taxfree.com.sg Retailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme. How much GST refund can I receive? The actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter. How do I obtain my GST refund? Do arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund.

For hand-carried items: Please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.
